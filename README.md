# How We Work



TC39 is the technical committee responsible for the standardization of javascript. You can read our formal scope on [the ECMA International website](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm).



## TODO

- [ ] **Rationale**  
  A document explaining what drives the decision we make as a body.
- [ ] **Jargon**  
  A document to serve as a glossary for acronyms and other terms vital to our work but perhaps not immediately obvious to anyone new
- [ ] A more humane explanation of what we do
- [ ] A TL;DR of Allen's excellent "Patterns for Participation" pdf that newcomers are given.
- [ ] A slightly longer, but still concise, version for people who are trying to wrap their heads around it but aren't ready for "what to do if/when i start"
- [ ] A package of information for people who want to get involved as non-members
- [ ] A package of information for people who want to get involved as members
- [ ] A longer to-do list with more specific documents (like rationale and jargon)
- [ ] would it make more sense for this to be a github wiki?
